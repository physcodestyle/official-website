# Distance learning in the conditions of the quarantine

![Distance learning in the conditions of the quarantine](/images/media-gallery/learn.jpg)

From March 17 in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection in the academic buildings of the university, as well as in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation from 14.03.2020 No. 397 and from 14.03.2020 No. 398, Voronezh State University switched to the educational process with the use of distance learning technologies, namely, online training using the electronic portal "Electronic University of VSU": edu.vsu.ru. Participation in this process is mandatory for all students. Since all work will be organized through the student's personal account, it is necessary to register on the portal. Instructions on how to do this can be found in our article: https://vk.com/@physvsu-eduvsuru

On the portal from March 17 until the end of the quarantine, teachers will post electronic courses that students are required to take. Tasks will be attached to them, and the time for completing some of them may be limited at the discretion of the teacher. All this can be seen in your personal account on edu.vsu.ru. Completing tasks and completing e-courses will affect the final grade in the subject. Keep an eye out for e-course updates every day.

Teachers may, at their discretion, use other online services for distance learning. You can learn about this from the dean's office, group leaders, or from the e-course itself at edu.vsu.ru

All students of the Faculty of Physics urgently need to register and start completing tasks!
