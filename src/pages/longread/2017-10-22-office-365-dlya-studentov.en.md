We tell how a student can get Office 365 for free. With it you can work with online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Together with the programs you will get 1000 GB in the cloud. The service is valid until the end of your training at the VSU.

How to connect:

1. Go to [information portal of VSU](https://info.vsu.ru/).

2. Enter your username and password. They match the ones you use to access wi-Fi at the University. Style suggest to select “Pronto”.

3. Send email with “Send credentials from Office 365” to: [helpdesk@vsu.ru](mailto:helpdesk@vsu.ru). The response letter will have to wait.

4. The letter will contain a temporary password, enter it on the page: [portal.office.com](http://portal.office.com).

5. The first time you log in, the system will ask you to set a new password, instead of a temporary one. Change and enter the system:

That's all. Now you can use the Office 365 package, but you can only use it until the end of your studies at the University.
