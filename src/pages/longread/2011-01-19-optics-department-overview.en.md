The origins of the Department
-----------------------------

The Department of optics and spectroscopy was established in 1961 by its first head associate Professor Elizaveta Nikolaevna Ivanova and a small group of teachers: S. M. Yazykova, N. N. Kirsanova, T. A. Oleynikova, R. P. Vorobieva, A. N. Latvian. Up to this point, they all worked at the Department of electromagnetic oscillations under the guidance of the world-famous prof.M. Levitskaya, where scientific research and specialists in optical spectroscopy of atoms, molecules and solids were produced.

By the time of creation of the Department methods of optical spectroscopy have already found wide application in many fields of science and technology. Therefore, spectroscopy engineers were in great demand in a variety of research centers of the Academy of Sciences, as well as spectral laboratories of many enterprises and expert centers.

The calendar counts down the years quickly, and now almost 50 years have passed. Many interesting and important events have taken place over the years. One of them – the creation of the Department of observation station for artificial satellites. Astronomical duties of students and teachers at night, encryption of telegrams to the observation center – with what interest and enthusiasm this work was carried out!

Along with teaching work, the first teachers of the Department were actively engaged in scientific research in the field of atomic and molecular spectroscopy. Senior lecturer N. N. Kirsanova with a group of students has devoted many years to the creation of a database of atomic constants of the spectrum. Associate Professor S. M. yazykova developed programs of theoretical courses on optical spectroscopy and together with her students E. V. Butyrskaya and V. I. Lisitsin conducted research work on the theory of small molecules.

The joint work of associate Professor R. P. Vorobyova and senior lecturer T. A. Oleinikova with scientists from the medical Institute and Department of organic chemistry of Voronezh state University, headed by Professor L. P. by Zalyaeva led to the development of interesting research areas in the field of molecular spectroscopy on a vital issue – the study of the structure of anticoagulants of blood, prevent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. About 200 scientific articles and reports at conferences are the result of the work of teachers and students on this topic.

A great contribution to the educational and scientific work of the Department was made by its laboratory staff in G. E. Kulikov and A. Lugovskoy, senior laboratory Assistant V. I. Lesnikov, L. F. Rakov. All of them want to Express their gratitude for the conscientious and selfless work, without which it would be impossible to work teachers and students.

In 1971, the Department was headed by Professor Anatoly Nikolaevich Latyshev. Since then, the Department of optics and spectroscopy began intensive research on spectroscopy and luminescence of solids. These works were the development of ideas formed by Anatoly Nikolaevich in the performance of his thesis, devoted to elucidation of the nature of fine structure in the absorption spectra of thin metal layers. The obtained scientific results put an end to numerous disputes concerning the nature of the fine structure, confirmed the existence of this phenomenon and allowed to interpret it as the electron-vibrational spectrum of silver nanoclusters. This work was the beginning of many years of research of the initial stage of the photographic process at the Voronezh University. A. N. Latyshev is engaged in serious scientific research, working closely with his Teacher, corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences Konstantin Vladimirovich Chibisov, who showed great interest in the study of scientific photography in the Voronezh state University.

As a result, a new class of photochemical processes on the surface of light-sensitive crystals with the participation of adsorbed atoms and ions was discovered by the research team under the leadership of Anatoly Nikolaevich. For the first time the physically grounded mechanism of the initial stage of the photographic process at restorative sensitization is formulated. Discovered a number of new effects related to the photostimulated preobrazovaniem surface defects, adsorbed melatonin clusters. Several methods of reversing recording and fluorescent reading of optical information are proposed. Methods of control of technological process of manufacturing of photographic layers are offered. Methods of control of production of phosphor coatings of color tubes are developed. There was a recognized in the scientific community school “photo-Stimulated processes on the surface of ion-covalent crystals”, closely associated with the Kemerovo and Odessa universities, GOI them. S. Vavilov Institute of Hematopoetic (Moscow and Kazan), with the Metrology Institute of the city of Braunschweig (Germany), Institute of problems of Chemical Physics RAS (Chernogolovka).

Under the guidance of A. N. Latysheva successfully defended his PhD thesis, M. I. Molotskii, L. B. Antonova, M. A. Kushnir, V. G. Klyuev, T. V. Voloshina, Yu. K. Timoshenko, L. J. Malaya, V. N. Rasheyev, L. S. Leonova, A. I. Kustov, V. A. Shunina, O. V. Ovchinnikov, P. E. Tatyanin, S. S. Okhotnikov, M. S. Smirnov, S. V. Chernykh, D. A. Minakov, A. M. Smirnov, P. V. Novikov, V. B. ZON. The scientific guidance of Professor M. G. Klyuev helped to become candidates of M. A. Yefimova, T. L. Mayorova, Yu. V. Vostrikova, E. A. Kosyakova.

Doctor’s dissertations defended by M. I. Molotsky, V. G. Klyuev, O. V. Ovchinnikov, and Tymoshenko. Professors G. F. Novikov and A. N. Latyshev together with the Institute of Problems of chemical physics RAS im. Akad. N. N. Semenova (Chernogolovka) created a joint research laboratory “Photostimulated processes in crystals”.

For big merits in scientific activity to the doctor of physical and mathematical Sciences, Professor Latyshev Anatoly Nikolaevich the decree of the President of the Russian Federation N 1093 of 20.08.2007 conferred the honorary title “the Honored worker of science of the Russian Federation”.

The Department has always been aimed at the development of the most modern technologies and processes in the domestic industry, the introduction of research and development. An important stage in its history was the work on the program of target intensive training of students (CIPS) on the basis of the plant of electric vacuum devices. For this purpose, special training programs of theoretical and experimental special courses, subjects of industrial practice and theses were created. Most of the graduates of those years worked in the plant of electric vacuum devices under the direction of the chief engineer Sergiyenko.

In 1988, the astrophysical laboratory and a branch of the Department were established on its basis. Here, as part of the training and production complex, one of the main tasks was the career guidance of students of Voronezh schools. To prepare students of the faculty of physics of VSU developed a program of theoretical and practical training of students in spectral analysis, astronomy, relativity, computer science. Astronomy consultations are held for school teachers.

Since 1996, a new specialization – “Physical and chemical methods of forensic examination”, and then “Optical and optoelectronic devices and systems”has been popular among students of physical faculty. in 2001, developed curricula and obtained a license for the opening of the Department of a new Department of secondary technical education in optical and optoelectronic devices systems.

One of the first in Russia Department of optics and spectroscopy in 1995 implemented a master’s program “Physics of optical phenomena” (head prof. Latyshev). About 100 masters-physicists who studied under this program were graduated. At present, the first issue of undergraduates is being prepared for another new program “Optics of nanostructured materials” (head of prof. Latyshev).

The Department is closely connected with the production and academic institutions. Joint works of fundamental and applied nature are carried out. The Department is actively involved in the implementation of scientific programs of grants of Russian and international funds. In the last 8 years, the Department is actively conducting applied research in the interests of the Ministry of defense.

Approaching its half-century anniversary, the Department occupies a worthy place among other departments of the faculty of physics of VSU. Four professors and five associate professors work here. For all time of its existence, the Department released about 1,000 professionals-opticians, operating worldwide in laboratories of major universities, businesses and laboratories. Among them there are many doctors and candidates of Sciences, honored workers of production. With the participation of graduates of the Department, space technology was created, the largest scientific research on astrophysics, applied optics, biochemistry of drugs was carried out, the element base of semiconductor technology, optical memory elements and special-purpose devices were developed.

There were no easy ways to achieve the goals. Many losses. Gone from Life E. N. Ivanova, N. N. Kirsanova, G. E. Kulikov, S. M. yazykova, some of the graduates of previous years. The bright memory of him!

Since 2010, the Department of optics and spectroscopy is headed by doctor of physical and mathematical Sciences O. V. Ovchinnikov, who continues the glorious work of his predecessors.
