1. Download the application convenient for you: iOS (installed at purchase), Android, PC or mac. Below we will give an example of setting for Android, although the steps are almost the same on different platforms. If you're confused or already have a paid subscription, read what [Apple's website](https://support.apple.com/ru-ru/HT205928).
2. Open the Apple Music app. If you don't see the Apple Music screen, tap Try at the bottom;
3. Select “for students” and click “ Confirm student status»;
4. You will be redirected to the UNiDSYs website, where you will need to specify the school: Voronezh State University, then specify the mail with the domain VSU. You already have it if you use wi - fi at the University;
5. Go to [the website](https://info.vsu.ru/) and enter the username and password of the wi-fi of the VSU (in the column Layout, select Pronto);
6. The letter confirms the status of the student;
7. Go back to the app, select again subscription “for students”. After that, you will be warned about the rules of subscription use.

If you are a new user, you will be offered 3 months of free subscription, with a further payment of 75 b. in the framework of the plan for students. Agree. The service will ask you to choose a payment method. Here we have problems and the card had to be tied through iTunes for the PC, but maybe you will not have such a problem.

That's all. Now you can use a discounted subscription until the end of your studies at the University.
