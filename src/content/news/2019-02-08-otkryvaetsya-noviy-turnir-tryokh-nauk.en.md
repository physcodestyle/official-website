The new season Of the tournament of Three Sciences opens.

At the competition, participants present solutions to problems in biology, chemistry and physics. Opponents look for mistakes and inaccuracies, and reviewers decide the outcome of the scientific battle.

The tournament is held in two stages: - the qualifying stage will be held in spring in each Federal district; - the final will take place in autumn at VSU.

Registration of teams will start soon, and for now the organizers offer to get acquainted with the list of tasks.
