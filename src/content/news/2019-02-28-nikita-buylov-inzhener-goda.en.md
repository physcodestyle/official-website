Nikita Builov, a post – graduate student of the Department of solid state Physics and nanostructures, won the Engineer of the year 2018 award.

The winner told about the competition and thanked his mentors: “today it is the most large-scale event in my life. Of the 70,000 engineers who took part in the regional tests, only 300 people became winners of the all-Russian competition. Such a serious selection indicates a high level of the event. I would like to Express my gratitude to two outstanding leaders, without whose help I would not have been among the winners – Evelina Pavlovna Domashevskaya, head of the Department of solid state physics and nanostructures of the VSU, who brought up in me a craving for science and improvement of their results and knowledge, and Boris Isaakovich Stepansky, head of the test center for certification of integrated circuits and microwave devices of JSC “NIIET”. During my career, he created all conditions for the development of engineering skills and put me up for participation in the competition.”
