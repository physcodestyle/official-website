Digital-Agency [Red Collar](https://vk.com/redcollar) will hold a series of lectures at VSU. The event will tell: - about the way to the post of art Director; - the effect of animation on the user experience; - what a designer can learn from a writer; - about 3D graphics in the service of the designer.

Lectures will be held on January 19 from 13: 00 to 18: 00 in the Assembly hall of the main building. To participate, [sign up](https://vk.cc/8V9LTg).

The next day after the lectures, the company’s office will host a workshop on design. To get to it, you need to send your portfolio and answer the question: “Why do you have to get to the workshop?”. Then the staff will select 8 winners, who will create the project under the leadership of the Red Collar team.
