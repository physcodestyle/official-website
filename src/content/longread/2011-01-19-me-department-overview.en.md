The origins of the Department
-----------------------------

The Department of semiconductor and microelectronics physics was established in 1959 in connection with the formation and development of the domestic electronic industry and the organization of a large scientific and production Association “electronics”in the Voronezh region.

Since the founding of the Department and in 1961 was the head of Katasonov Nikolai Vasilyevich, associate Professor, Department of physics, faculty of physics, Voronezh state University.

Since 2003. and currently is head of the Department of Bormontov Evgeny Nikolaevich, leading specialist in semiconductor physics and microelectronics.
