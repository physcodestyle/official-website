The origins of the Department
-----------------------------

The Department of electromagnetic oscillations was founded in 1936 by Professor Maria Afanasievna Levitskaya (1883 - 1963) - one of the first Russian female scientists who discovered submillimeter waves in the scale of electromagnetic oscillations.

Department of electromagnetic oscillations in 1961 became known as the Department of solid state physics after separation of the Department of Optics and the Department of Nuclear Physics.

Glorious pages in the history of the Department entered the veterans of the great Patriotic war associate Professor V. S. Kavetsky and associate Professor N. Ah. Ignatiev and associate Professor R. L. Fogelson.

In December 2006, on the initiative of Professor E. p. Domashevskaya order of the rector of VSU Department was named “ Department of solid state physics and nanostructures.”

#### The origins of solid state physics

The birth of solid state physics at the Voronezh state University is connected with the name of Maria Afanasievna, A colleague of the famous academician A. F. Ioffe, the first female Professor of the VSU, who was invited in 1935 to head the Department of theoretical physics, and then the Department of electromagnetic oscillations. In 1961, the latter became known as the Department of solid state physics, after it separated from several other departments, originated in its depths, including the Department of optics and nuclear physics. Why did the basic Department become known as the Department of solid state physics? Because, in the 20 – th years of the löwitzian solid state physics, They studied the electro – mechanical and deformation properties of the classical solids-monocrystals of rock salt and quartz by x-ray methods, which they mastered in Germany at the time of the great V. K. Roentgen. Thus, at the Department of solid state physics from its very Foundation established and developed as the main methods of research of solids and materials is x - ray methods-x-ray and x-ray spectral, allowing to obtain data on the atomic structure and the electron energy spectrum of matter, respectively. X-ray diffraction studies of metals and alloys, and then semiconductors engaged associate professors N. Ignatiev, R. L., Vogelson. A. Vodopyanova, K. Aleynikova. X-ray methods of investigation of semiconductor compounds, since the late 50-ies of the last century, used in his research, associate Professor V. S. Kavetsky, assistant I. Kaplunov and graduate student M. A. Levitskaya E. P. Domashevskaya.

The impetus for the growth of the Voronezh school of solid state electronic structure research was the rapid development of semiconductor physics. Since the middle of the last century, due to Schottky's discoveries of the rectifying properties of metal-semiconductor heterocontact, there has been a real boom in the synthesis of new semiconductor compounds and materials suitable for use in various fields of technology, primarily in electronics and optoelectronics. This boom has not escaped the Akademik Ioffe, the head of several decades physico-technical Institute, USSR Academy of Sciences in Leningrad.

In PTI were synthesized and studied single crystals of semiconductor compounds numerous different types of III-V semiconductors, AIIBVI, AIIBIVCVII and others. Much of the credit for these studies belongs to Nina Goryunova, who infected with his enthusiasm the young associate Professor of VSU Ya. a. Ugai, who organized the work in Voronezh on the synthesis and research of a new class of semiconductor compounds AIIB, formed as a result of chemical interaction of the group II (zinc, cadmium) and nonmetals of the Voy group (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony). In Voronezh, for the first time x-ray diffraction patterns of zinc-phosphorus, cadmium-phosphorus, zinc-antimony, zinc-arsenic, cadmium-antimony, cadmium-arsenic were studied, structures of numerous compounds were determined, and the previously unknown compound Cd6P7 (A. V. Arsenov, K. B. Aleynikova, A. N. Aleynikov) was discovered. Lukin).

Also, for the first time a graduate student E. p. Domashevskaya received experimental evidence of charge transfer from metals of the second and third groups to non - metals of the fifth group in the formation of semiconductor compounds of types aiibv and AIIBVI, measuring the shifts of Ka-lines of the characteristic x-ray spectrum of elements in these compounds. The results were reported at the Second all-Union conference on semiconductor physics in January 1962 in Leningrad, and later at the international conference on chemical communication in semiconductors in Minsk, which was attended by such luminaries of semiconductor science as the Americans Gudinaf and Muzer, the Frenchman SUSE and others. The same results were published in the reports of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, as well as in the materials of international conferences, later translated into the United States. The fact is that the obtained data on the positive chemical shifts of the metal component and negative chemical shifts on nonmetallic ones put an end to the dispute about the mechanisms of chemical bond formation in semiconductors and irrefutably justified the new donor-acceptor model due to the Unallocated electron pair of valence electrons in the elements of the Voy group instead of the old speculative sp3 - hybrid model of Muzer and Pearson, in which a negative charge was to appear on the metal component. With these works at the Department of solid state physics begins semiconductor “period”.
